# Chip-8!
Another Chip-8 implementation, woo! ðŸŽ‰


## ToDo
- [ ] CI/CD
  - [ ] Pick a CI
  - [ ] List tools needed to build
  - [ ] Reproducable builds on push
  - [ ] Serve build artifacts (github pages?)  
- [ ] Display
  - [x] Divide canvas into "pixels"
    - [ ] With support for multiple resolutions
  - [x] Draw to canvas from Rust
  - [x] Draw sprites to canvas
    - [x] With collision detection
- [x] Keyboard
- [ ] Timers
  - [ ] Sounds (w/buzzer)
  - [ ] Delay
- [ ] System
  - [ ] Timers/Delays
  - [ ] Emulation loop MVP
  - [ ] Macros for generic instruction implementation
  - [ ] Instruction set 25% defined
  - [ ] Instruction set 50% defined
  - [ ] Instruction set 90% defined


## Purpose
Two reasons I'm building this:
1. Getting familiar with WASM + Rust.
2. Jump off point for improving my 6502 emulator. Emulating the screen is a problem I haven't solved yet. The Chip-8 screen is pretty simple, so it should be an easy start.

## Quirks and Extensions
There are a lot of popular Chip-8 implementations and since there is no concrete spec for the Chip-8 system, each implementation has it's own quirks and extensions. I'll support what I can based on time/difficulty and guard these with feature flags.
