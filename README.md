# Chip-8!
Another Chip-8 implementation, woo! ðŸŽ‰

## ToDo
- [ ] CI/CD
  - [ ] Builds on push
  - [ ] Serve build artifacts (github pages?)  
- [ ] Display
  - [ ] Support for multiple resolutions
- [ ] Sounds (w/buzzer)
- [ ] Fix bugs
  - [ ] Intense flickering on some roms
  - [ ] Drawing on the very edge of the screen causes panic
  - [ ] Some roms just don't do anything

## Purpose
Two reasons I'm building this:
1. Getting familiar with WASM + Rust.
2. Jump off point for improving my 6502 emulator. Emulating the screen is a problem I haven't solved yet. The Chip-8 screen is pretty simple, so it should be an easy start.
